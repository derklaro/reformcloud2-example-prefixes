# ReformCloud2 Prefix System [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/499666347337449472.svg?color=7289DA&label=discord)](https://discord.gg/uskXdVZ)
This repository provides a simple prefix system which works for a [ReformCloud](https://github.com/derklaro/reformcloud2) 
based server. You can just put this into your template and restart the process. Then edit the configuration
file and copy your running server into the template using `process NAME copy`. After that process, restart
your server again and use the prefix system!

## Requirements
 1) Of course the plugin needs a running [ReformCloud](https://github.com/derklaro/reformcloud2) installation.
 2) The plugin needs the ReformCloud permission system to be installed else the startup of the server will fail.
 
## Download
You can download the plugin from the [download server](https://dl.reformcloud.systems/plugins/reformcloud2-prefixes-latest.jar).
